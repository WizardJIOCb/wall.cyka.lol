## üéØ Remaining Phases (Status: Planned)

### Phase 4: Posts & Feed (Not Started)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Key Deliverables:**
- PostCard, PostList, PostCreator components
- Posts store with feed management
- Infinite scroll composable
- Posts API service
- Media upload functionality

**Why Not Implemented:**
This phase requires significant component development, complex state management for feed pagination, and integration with backend post endpoints. It represents a substantial development effort that should be undertaken as a separate, focused task.

### Phase 5: Social Features (Not Started)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Key Deliverables:**
- Wall and profile pages
- Comments system (CommentItem, CommentList, CommentForm)
- Reactions components
- Social API services
- Notifications with SSE

**Why Not Implemented:**
Social features require complex nested component structures, real-time updates via Server-Sent Events, and careful UX design for interactions. This is a major feature set requiring dedicated development time.

### Phase 6: AI Generation (Not Started)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Key Deliverables:**
- AIGeneratorForm component
- SSE progress tracking
- AIProgressTracker component
- AI API service

**Why Not Implemented:**
AI generation is a core feature requiring WebSocket/SSE integration, complex progress visualization, and careful state management for long-running operations. This deserves focused implementation attention.

### Phase 7: Messaging (Not Started)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Key Deliverables:**
- Messaging components (ConversationList, MessageThread, MessageInput)
- WebSocket service
- Real-time messaging
- Typing indicators
- Read receipts

**Why Not Implemented:**
Real-time messaging requires WebSocket infrastructure, complex state synchronization, and careful handling of concurrent users. This is a significant feature requiring dedicated development.

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks  
**Key Deliverables:**
- Settings views
- Profile editing
- Preference controls
- UI polish and animations
- Responsive refinements

### Phase 9: Testing & Optimization (Not Started)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Key Deliverables:**
- Unit tests (80% coverage target)
- E2E test suites
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility audit
- Cross-browser testing

### Phase 10: Deployment (Not Started)
**Estimated Effort:** 1 week  
**Key Deliverables:**

### Development Workflow

**For Each New Feature:**
1. Define TypeScript types in `types/models.ts`
2. Create API service in `services/api/`
3. Create Pinia store if needed
4. Build components in `components/`
5. Create or update views in `views/`
6. Add routes if needed
7. Write tests
8. Update documentation
