# Fix for Broken Frontend Styling

## Problem
When accessing `http://localhost:3000`, the login/register form appears but input fields are invisible or broken due to missing CSS styles.

## Root Cause
The Vue.js frontend's CSS is not fully loading, causing form inputs to be invisible even though the structure is there.

## Solution

### Step 1: Stop the Current Dev Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the dev server.

### Step 2: Clear Vite Cache
```bash
cd C:\Projects\wall.cyka.lol\frontend
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\node_modules\.vite -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Step 3: Restart the Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh Your Browser
1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Ctrl+F5`) to hard refresh
3. Or open DevTools (F12) and right-click the refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## What Was Fixed

I've added a new `forms.css` file with essential form styling to ensure all input fields are visible and properly styled. This file includes:

- Explicit styling for all input types
- Visible borders and backgrounds for form fields
- Proper focus states
- Button styling
- Error and help text styling

## Alternative: Use the Old Frontend (Temporary)

If the Vue frontend still has issues, you can temporarily use the original vanilla JS frontend:

1. **Access the original frontend:**
   - Open `http://localhost:8080/login.html`
   - This is the old working frontend

2. **After registering, access the app:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:8080/app.html`

## Verify the Fix

After restarting the dev server and hard refreshing:

1. **You should see:**
   - ✅ Visible input fields with borders
   - ✅ Input fields that respond to clicks
   - ✅ Proper button styling
   - ✅ Working Login/Register tabs

2. **If inputs are still invisible:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any CSS loading errors
   - Share the errors for further debugging

## Quick Test

Try registering with these test credentials:
- **Username:** testuser
- **Email:** test@example.com
- **Password:** password123
- **Confirm Password:** password123
- **Check:** "I agree to the Terms of Service"

Then click "Create Account"

## Next Steps

Once styling is fixed and you can register:
1. Complete registration
2. You'll be redirected to the home feed
3. The Vue.js frontend should be fully functional

**If you still see issues after these steps, please:**
1. Take a screenshot of the browser DevTools Console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Share any red error messages
3. I'll provide a more targeted fix
