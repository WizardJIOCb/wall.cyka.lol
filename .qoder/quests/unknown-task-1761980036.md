---

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Critical Path (Required for MVP)

**1. Database Migration Execution** (Priority: CRITICAL, Time: 30 minutes)

Execute the 4 pending migration files to add missing tables and columns:

**Migration Files**:
- 001_add_user_follows.sql - Follow relationships table
- 002_add_notifications.sql - Notifications table
- 003_add_user_preferences.sql - User preferences table
- 004_add_conversations.sql - Messaging tables

**Impact**: Without these migrations, Follow, Notifications, Settings, and Messaging features will fail.

**Action**:
- Navigate to database directory
- Run migration script: php run_migrations.php
- Verify tables created in MySQL

**2. Frontend Production Build** (Priority: HIGH, Time: 15 minutes)

Build the Vue.js frontend for production deployment:

**Current State**: Frontend code exists but not built to public directory

**Impact**: Users accessing http://localhost:8080 see PHP welcome page instead of Vue app

**Action**:
- Navigate to frontend directory
- Run: npm install (if not done)
- Run: npm run build
- Verify assets in /public directory

**3. Frontend-Backend Integration** (Priority: HIGH, Time: 2-4 hours)

Complete API integration for all views:

**Views Requiring Integration**:
- Profile View - Connect to user profile API
- Notifications View - Implement polling for notifications
- Discover View - Connect trending and search APIs
- Messages View - Implement conversation loading and sending
- Settings View - Connect preferences and password change APIs

**Components Requiring Enhancement**:
- PostCard - Add reaction buttons with API calls
- CommentSection - Implement comment creation and replies
- UserCard - Add follow/unfollow button functionality

**4. Real-time Features Implementation** (Priority: MEDIUM, Time: 4-6 hours)

Implement real-time updates for better UX:

**Polling Strategy** (Simpler, recommended for MVP):
- Notifications polling every 30 seconds
- Message polling every 5 seconds when conversation open
- Typing indicator polling every 2 seconds
- Unread count updates every 60 seconds

**WebSocket Strategy** (Better, but more complex):
- Set up WebSocket server (Ratchet or Socket.IO)
- Implement message broadcasting
- Update frontend to use WebSocket connections
- Handle connection states and reconnection

**5. Testing & Validation** (Priority: HIGH, Time: 4-6 hours)

Comprehensive testing of all features:

**Backend API Testing**:
- Test all 103 endpoints with Postman/Insomnia

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk: Database Migration Failures**
- Probability: Low
- Impact: High
- Mitigation: Test migrations on copy of database first, have rollback scripts ready

**Risk: Frontend-Backend API Mismatch**
- Probability: Medium
- Impact: Medium
- Mitigation: Document all API contracts, use TypeScript for type safety, test endpoints before integration

**Risk: Performance Issues Under Load**
- Probability: Medium
- Impact: High
- Mitigation: Implement caching early, load test before launch, have scaling plan ready

**Risk: Security Vulnerabilities**
- Probability: Medium
- Impact: Critical
- Mitigation: Follow security checklist, conduct security audit, implement rate limiting

**Risk: Ollama Service Downtime**
- Probability: Medium
- Impact: Medium
- Mitigation: Queue system buffers requests, error handling with refunds, monitor service health

### Process Risks

**Risk: Scope Creep**
- Probability: High
- Impact: Medium
- Mitigation: Stick to phased plan, defer non-critical features, focus on MVP first

**Risk: Testing Inadequacy**
- Probability: Medium
- Impact: High
- Mitigation: Allocate dedicated testing time, create test checklists, automated tests where possible

**Risk: Documentation Gaps**
- Probability: Low
- Impact: Low
- Mitigation: Document as you build, maintain API documentation, update design docs
