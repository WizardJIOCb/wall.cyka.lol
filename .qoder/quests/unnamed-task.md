## Implementation Priority Roadmap

### Phase 5: Social Features (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Enable core social interactions between users

#### Week 1: Comments System

**Objective:** Users can comment on posts with nested replies and reactions

**Database Requirements:**

Table: comments
- Primary fields: id, post_id, user_id, parent_comment_id, content, created_at, updated_at, edited_at
- Counters: reaction_count, reply_count
- Status: is_deleted, is_edited
- Constraints: Foreign keys to posts and users tables, self-referencing for parent_comment_id

**Backend API Endpoints:**

Comment Management:
- GET /api/v1/posts/{postId}/comments - Retrieve all comments for a post (flat or tree structure)
- POST /api/v1/posts/{postId}/comments - Create top-level comment
- POST /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/replies - Create nested reply
- PATCH /api/v1/comments/{commentId} - Edit comment content
- DELETE /api/v1/comments/{commentId} - Soft delete comment
- POST /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions - React to comment
- DELETE /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions - Remove reaction

**Business Logic:**

Comment Creation Flow:
1. Validate user authentication and post existence
2. Check comment content length (max 2000 characters)
3. Validate parent comment exists if creating reply
4. Sanitize comment content for XSS prevention
5. Create comment record with appropriate parent reference
6. Increment post comment_count or parent reply_count
7. Create notification for post owner or parent comment author
8. Return created comment with author details

Comment Editing Rules:
- Only comment author can edit
- Edits allowed within 15 minutes of creation
- Mark comment as edited with timestamp
- Preserve original content in edit history

Comment Deletion Strategy:
- Soft delete to preserve comment tree structure
- Replace content with "[deleted]" placeholder
- Retain metadata for moderation purposes
- Cascade delete if no replies exist

**Frontend Components:**

CommentSection Component:
- Display comments in tree structure or flat chronological view

- Fields: id, user_id, reactable_type, reactable_id, reaction_type
- Reaction types: like, dislike, heart, laugh, wow, sad, angry (extensible)
- Unique constraint: one reaction per user per item
- Indexes: composite index on (reactable_type, reactable_id, user_id)

**Backend API Endpoints:**

Reaction Management:
- POST /api/v1/posts/{postId}/reactions - Add or update reaction to post
- DELETE /api/v1/posts/{postId}/reactions - Remove reaction from post
