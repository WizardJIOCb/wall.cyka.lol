## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

AI Generation Performance
- Risk: Ollama may be slow or unreliable under load
- Mitigation: Queue system to manage concurrent requests, timeout handling, fallback to error state, consider GPU acceleration

Real-Time Features Complexity
- Risk: WebSocket/SSE implementation challenging, potential race conditions
- Mitigation: Use proven libraries, thorough testing, fallback to polling if needed

Database Performance
- Risk: Large dataset queries may slow down
- Mitigation: Implement caching aggressively, optimize indexes, consider read replicas, denormalize where appropriate

Security Vulnerabilities
- Risk: User-generated content (AI apps, posts) may introduce XSS or other attacks
- Mitigation: Strict input validation, HTML sanitization, sandboxed iframes, regular security audits

### Resource Risks

Development Timeline
- Risk: Features may take longer than estimated
- Mitigation: Prioritize core features, implement MVPs first, iterate based on feedback

Team Capacity
- Risk: Single developer may face bottlenecks or burnout
- Mitigation: Clear prioritization, modular development, consider additional help for critical phases

Infrastructure Costs
- Risk: Ollama AI generation may consume significant resources
- Mitigation: Bricks system to throttle usage, monitor resource consumption, optimize generation parameters

### User Experience Risks

Complexity Overload
- Risk: Too many features may confuse users
- Mitigation: Progressive disclosure, clear onboarding, prioritize simplicity in UI

Performance Perception
- Risk: AI generation wait times may frustrate users
- Mitigation: Transparent queue position, accurate time estimates, background processing with notifications

Content Quality
- Risk: AI-generated applications may be low quality or inappropriate
- Mitigation: Prompt engineering to improve quality, content moderation, user reporting, community rating

## Conclusion

Wall Social Platform has a solid foundation with a fully functional backend (authentication, posts, walls, AI generation, bricks system) and a modern Vue.js frontend framework. Core features are operational and testable, providing approximately 40% completion of the full vision.

The remaining work focuses on social interaction features (comments, reactions, messaging), content discovery (search, feeds, trending), and AI enhancements (remix, templates, collections). With disciplined execution following the prioritized roadmap, the platform can reach production readiness in 18-24 weeks with continued development.

Immediate testing of existing features is highly recommended to validate architecture and identify any issues before building additional complexity on top of the foundation.

The platform's unique value proposition—AI-generated applications with social remixing—positions it to offer innovative collaborative learning and creative expression capabilities once all features are implemented.
