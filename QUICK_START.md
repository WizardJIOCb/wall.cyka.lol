## Quick Start Commands

`ash
# 1. Set up Docker environment
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Create database
mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql

# 3. Install dependencies
composer install

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# 5. Start Ollama
ollama serve
ollama pull deepseek-coder

# 6. Start queue worker
php src/Workers/AIGenerationWorker.php

# 7. Access application
http://localhost
`

## Key Implementation Files Needed

1. **Database**: database/schema.sql - Full MySQL schema
2. **Config**: config/*.php - Application configuration
3. **Entry Point**: public/index.php - Router
4. **Controllers**: src/Controllers/ - Request handlers
5. **Models**: src/Models/ - Data models
6. **Services**: src/Services/ - Business logic
7. **Workers**: src/Workers/AIGenerationWorker.php - Queue processor
8. **Frontend**: public/assets/ - CSS/JS files

## Critical Success Factors

✓ AI generation success rate > 85%
✓ Generation time < 30 seconds average
✓ Real-time updates working smoothly
✓ Remix/fork feature engaging users
✓ Responsive design on all devices
✓ Security: code sanitization, CSP
✓ Performance: caching, optimization

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Review full design in README.md
2. Set up development environment
3. Create database schema
4. Implement authentication
5. Build AI generation system
6. Add social features
7. Polish and launch
