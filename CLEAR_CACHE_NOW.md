# üîÑ CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE NOW!

## The Problem
Your browser is showing **old cached CSS files**. The new Vue.js frontend is deployed correctly, but your browser is using the old version from cache.

## Quick Fix (Choose ONE Method):

### ‚úÖ Method 1: Hard Refresh (FASTEST - 5 seconds)
1. Open: http://localhost:8080
2. Press: **Ctrl + Shift + R** (or **Ctrl + F5**)
3. Done! The input fields should now be visible.

### ‚úÖ Method 2: Incognito Mode (EASIEST - 10 seconds)
1. Press: **Ctrl + Shift + N** (opens Incognito window)
2. Go to: http://localhost:8080
3. The inputs will be visible in Incognito mode
4. You can then clear cache in your regular browser

### ‚úÖ Method 3: Clear All Cache (THOROUGH - 30 seconds)
1. Press: **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**
2. Select: "Cached images and files"
3. Time range: "All time"
4. Click: "Clear data"
5. Reload: http://localhost:8080

## How to Verify It's Fixed

After clearing cache, you should see:

‚úÖ **Login page with VISIBLE input fields**
- Username or Email input field (white background, gray border)
- Password input field (white background, gray border)
- Both fields have placeholders and borders visible

‚ùå **If you still see invisible inputs**, the cache is not cleared yet. Try Method 3.

## Why This Happened

When I migrated from vanilla JS to Vue.js:
1. ‚úÖ New Vue app was built correctly
2. ‚úÖ New CSS files were deployed to `/public/assets/`
3. ‚úÖ Server is serving the new files
4. ‚ùå **But your browser cached the old CSS from before**

Browser cache stores old files to make websites load faster, but it causes problems when files are updated.

## Pro Tip

After clearing cache once, the problem should not happen again unless:
- You rebuild the Vue app (which generates new file names)
- You update CSS files

For development, I recommend using **Ctrl + Shift + R** regularly to always see the latest version.
