4. **Included token usage** in all documentation headers
5. **Organized documentation** with clear structure and guidelines

### üìã Files Created

```
C:\Projects\wall.cyka.lol\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .qoder\quests\
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unknown-task-1761982115.md (1,835 lines - design doc)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ history\
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (176 lines - folder index)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.md (529 lines - instructions)

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20251101-documentation-organization.md (this file)
```

### üìù Recommendations for Future

1. **Move historical reports to history/** - 40+ .md files in root should be reviewed and moved
2. **Keep only core docs in root** - README.md, QUICKSTART.md, DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
3. **Use naming convention** - YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-description.md for new docs
4. **Update run.md** when deployment procedures change
5. **Create progress reports** after each phase completion
