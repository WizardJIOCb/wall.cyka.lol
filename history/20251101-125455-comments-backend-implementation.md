- CommentController with 11 API endpoints
- Enhanced Reaction model with bulk query support
- Integration with existing Comment model
- Notification triggers for comment interactions
- Full CRUD operations for nested comments

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. CommentController (NEW)

**File Created:** `src/Controllers/CommentController.php` (534 lines)

**API Endpoints Implemented:**

#### Comment Management (7 endpoints)
- `GET /api/v1/posts/{postId}/comments` - Retrieve all comments for a post
- `POST /api/v1/posts/{postId}/comments` - Create top-level comment
- `POST /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/replies` - Create nested reply
- `GET /api/v1/comments/{commentId}` - Get single comment with replies
- `PATCH /api/v1/comments/{commentId}` - Edit comment content
- `DELETE /api/v1/comments/{commentId}` - Soft delete comment
- *(Total: 7 comment CRUD endpoints)*

#### Comment Reactions (4 endpoints)
- `POST /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions` - React to comment
- `DELETE /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions` - Remove reaction
- `GET /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions` - Get reaction summary
- `GET /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions/users` - Get users who reacted
- *(Total: 4 comment reaction endpoints)*

**Total New Endpoints:** 11

**Features Implemented:**

Comment Creation:
- Content validation (1-2000 characters)
- XSS sanitization with htmlspecialchars
- Parent comment verification
- Nesting depth limit (max 5 levels)
- Automatic counter updates (post, parent comment, user)
- Notification creation for post/comment authors

Comment Editing:
- Ownership verification
- 15-minute edit window
- Content sanitization
- Edit timestamp tracking
- is_edited flag management

Comment Deletion:
- Soft delete to preserve thread structure
- Ownership verification
- Counter decrements
- User statistics updates

Comment Reactions:
- Toggle behavior (same reaction = remove)
- Reaction type validation (like, dislike, heart, laugh, wow, sad, angry)
- Notification on new reactions
- Real-time counter updates
- Pagination for "who reacted" list

Query Features:
- Sorting options (created_asc, created_desc, reactions)
- Parent filtering (top-level vs replies)
- User reaction state inclusion
- Pagination support

### 2. Enhanced Reaction Model

**File Modified:** `src/Models/Reaction.php` (+114 lines)

**New Methods Added:**

```php
// Toggle behavior for reactions
addOrUpdate($userId, $targetType, $targetId, $reactionType)

// Wrapper for consistency
remove($userId, $targetType, $targetId)

// Grouped reaction summary
getSummary($targetType, $targetId)

// Paginated user list
getUsers($targetType, $targetId, $reactionType, $limit, $offset)

// Bulk query for multiple targets
getUserReactions($userId, $targetType, array $targetIds)
```

**Benefits:**
- Efficient bulk queries for comment lists
- Toggle behavior (click same reaction to remove)
- Paginated user lists for "who reacted" modals
- Flexible reaction type filtering

### 3. API Router Updates

**File Modified:** `public/api.php` (+27 lines)

**Changes:**
- Replaced SocialController comment routes with CommentController
- Added 4 new comment reaction endpoints
- Added nested reply endpoint
- Updated status message (80 API endpoints)

**Routing Pattern:**
```
POST   /api/v1/posts/{postId}/comments
POST   /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/replies
GET    /api/v1/comments/{commentId}
PATCH  /api/v1/comments/{commentId}
DELETE /api/v1/comments/{commentId}
POST   /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions
DELETE /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions
GET    /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions
GET    /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/reactions/users
```

## Technical Details

### Security Measures

**Input Validation:**
- Comment content length: 1-2000 characters
- Parent comment existence verification
- Post existence verification
- Nesting depth limit: 5 levels
- Reaction type whitelist validation

**Authorization:**
- User must be authenticated for all write operations
- Only comment author can edit/delete
- Wall comment permissions respected
- 15-minute edit window enforced

**XSS Prevention:**
- HTML sanitization with `htmlspecialchars()`
- ENT_QUOTES flag for comprehensive escaping
- UTF-8 encoding specified

**Rate Limiting Recommendations:**
- 10 comments per minute per user (to be implemented)
- 20 reactions per minute per user (to be implemented)

### Database Operations

**Transaction Safety:**
- Comment creation uses transactions
- Counter updates are atomic
- Rollback on any failure
- Consistent state guaranteed

**Denormalized Counters:**
Updated automatically:
- `posts.comment_count` - Total comments on post
- `comments.reply_count` - Replies to each comment
- `comments.reaction_count` - Total reactions on comment
- `comments.like_count` - Like reactions
- `comments.dislike_count` - Dislike reactions
- `users.comments_count` - User's total comments

**Indexes Used:**
- `comments(post_id, created_at)` - Fast comment retrieval
- `reactions(reactable_type, reactable_id, user_id)` - Reaction lookups
- `comments(parent_comment_id)` - Reply threading

### Performance Optimizations

**Bulk Queries:**
- `getUserReactions()` fetches user reactions for all comments in one query
- Reduces N+1 query problem in comment lists
- Uses IN clause with parameterized queries

**Caching Opportunities:**
- Comment trees can be cached per post
- Reaction counts cached with 5-minute TTL
- "Who reacted" lists cached briefly

**Pagination:**
- Default limit: 50 comments per request
- Maximum limit: 100 comments per request
- Offset-based pagination for reaction users

---

## Integration Points

### Notifications

**Triggers Created:**
- New comment on post → Notify post author
- Reply to comment → Notify comment author
- Reaction on comment → Notify comment author
- @mention in comment → Notify mentioned user (future)

**Notification Types Used:**
- `new_comment` - For comments and replies
- `reaction` - For comment reactions

### Existing Models

**Dependencies:**
- `Comment` model - Uses all existing methods
- `Post` model - Fetches post data for validation
- `Wall` model - Checks comment permissions
- `Reaction` model - Enhanced with new methods
- `NotificationService` - Creates notifications
- `Database` - Transaction management
- `AuthMiddleware` - User authentication

---
