## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Flow

1. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Projects\wall.cyka.lol\frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access at: http://localhost:3000

2. **Start Backend Services:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Projects\wall.cyka.lol
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Test Comment Creation:**
   - Navigate to home feed
   - Click comment button (üí¨) on any post
   - Type a comment in the textarea
   - Click "Comment" button
   - Verify comment appears in the list

4. **Test Nested Replies:**
   - Click "Reply" button on any comment
   - Type a reply
   - Click "Reply" button
   - Verify reply appears nested under parent comment
   - Test up to 4 levels of nesting

5. **Test Comment Editing:**
   - Click edit button (‚úèÔ∏è) on your own comment
   - Modify the text
   - Click "Update" button
   - Verify comment shows "edited" badge
   - Try editing after 15 minutes (should be disabled)

6. **Test Comment Deletion:**
   - Click delete button (üóëÔ∏è) on your own comment
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify comment is removed from list

7. **Test Reactions:**
   - Click reaction button (üëç) on any comment
   - Select a reaction from the picker
   - Verify reaction count updates
   - Change reaction type
   - Remove reaction by clicking again

8. **Test Sorting:**
   - Change sort dropdown to "Newest first"
   - Verify comments reorder
   - Try "Most reactions" sorting
   - Verify comments sort by reaction count

9. **Test Theme Switching:**
   - Switch between light and dark themes
   - Verify comments section adapts to theme
   - Check readability in all 6 themes

10. **Test Mobile Responsiveness:**
    - Resize browser to mobile width
    - Verify comment indentation adjusts
    - Check touch-friendly button sizes
    - Verify textarea auto-resize works

### Edge Cases to Test

- Empty comment submission (should be disabled)
- 2000+ character comment (should show error)
- Editing non-owned comment (buttons should not appear)
- Comment without reactions (reaction count should not show)
- Post without comments (should show "No comments yet")
- Rapid comment creation (test rate limiting)
- Network errors (should show error message)
- Long comment content (should wrap properly)
- Comments with special characters and emojis

## Known Limitations

1. **Load More Pagination:** Currently placeholder - needs cursor/offset implementation
2. **Real-time Updates:** Uses 10-second polling instead of WebSocket/SSE
3. **Reaction Animations:** Basic transitions, could add more engaging animations
4. **Image/Media in Comments:** Not yet supported
5. **@Mentions:** Not implemented
6. **Comment Search:** Not available
7. **Report/Flag Comments:** Not implemented
8. **Moderation Tools:** Basic delete only

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Testing Phase)

1. **Run Manual Tests:** Execute all testing flows above
2. **Fix Any Bugs:** Address issues discovered during testing
3. **Test with Backend:** Ensure API integration works correctly
4. **Cross-browser Testing:** Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
5. **Performance Testing:** Test with 100+ comments on a single post

### Week 2-3: Reactions System Enhancement

Following the roadmap, next priorities are:
- Enhanced ReactionPicker component with animations
- ReactionDisplay component showing aggregated counts
- WhoReactedModal showing list of users who reacted
- Post-level reactions (already backend complete)
- Reaction animations and effects

### Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)

- WebSocket/SSE for real-time comments
- @Mentions with autocomplete
- Comment search within post
- Report/flag inappropriate comments
- Moderation queue for wall owners
- Media attachments in comments
- Link preview generation
- Comment drafts (auto-save)
- Keyboard shortcuts (J/K navigation)
- Comment permalinks

---

## Architecture Notes

### Component Reusability

The comment components are designed to be reusable:
- `CommentForm` can be used standalone for any comment input
- `CommentItem` recursively handles any depth of nesting
- `CommentSection` can be integrated into any content type (not just posts)

### Performance Considerations

- Comments are cached in Pinia store by post ID
- Optimistic UI updates for reactions (instant feedback)
- Lazy loading for nested replies
- Auto-resize textarea prevents layout shift
- Polling can be disabled by clearing interval

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Focus management
- Screen reader friendly labels
- WCAG AA contrast compliance

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ **Implementation Complete:** All planned features implemented  
‚úÖ **API Integration:** All 11 backend endpoints connected  
‚úÖ **Internationalization:** Full EN/RU translation support  
‚úÖ **Responsive Design:** Works on mobile and desktop  
‚úÖ **Theme Support:** Compatible with all 6 themes  
‚úÖ **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage  
‚úÖ **Code Quality:** No linting or compilation errors  

---

## Conclusion

The Comments System UI is now **fully implemented and integrated** into the Wall Social Platform. Users can engage in threaded discussions with unlimited nesting (UI limits to 4 levels for UX), react with 7 different emoji reactions, and manage their own comments.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user engagement and social interaction. The next priority is to enhance the reactions system with more engaging UI and animations, followed by integrating real-time updates via WebSocket or SSE.

**Backend Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (CommentController with 11 endpoints)  
**Frontend Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (3 components, store, types, i18n, integration)  
**Testing Status:** ‚è≥ Pending manual testing  
**Documentation Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  

**Ready for:** Manual testing and user feedback
