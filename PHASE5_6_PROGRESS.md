---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Sequential Implementation (Recommended)

**Proceed with Week 3-4: Social Connections**

**Rationale:**
- Builds on completed comments/reactions infrastructure
- Enables richer social interactions
- Required for personalized discovery (Weeks 5-7)
- Moderate complexity, manageable scope

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 days of focused development

---

### Option 2: Jump to High-Value Features

**Proceed with Week 5-6: Search System**

**Rationale:**
- High user value - search is critical for content discovery
- Can work independently of social connections
- Unlocks findability of existing content
- Immediate UX improvement

**Trade-off:** Social graph won't influence search relevance yet

**Estimated Time:** 5-6 days of focused development

---

### Option 3: Testing & Polish

**Focus on Testing Completed Features**

**Rationale:**
- 0% test coverage currently
- Comments and reactions are complex systems
- Validate integration before adding more features
- Ensure quality and stability

**Tasks:**
- Write PHPUnit tests for CommentController
- Write Vitest tests for comment/reaction components
- Integration tests for full comment flow
- Performance testing for nested comments
- Security testing for XSS prevention

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues

   - **Issue:** Import path for `@/services/api` may differ in project structure
   - **Impact:** Low - will resolve when integrated into main project
   - **Status:** Noted, no action required in current session

### No Critical Issues Identified

All implemented code compiled successfully with no syntax errors or blocking problems.

## 🎓 Technical Learnings

### Patterns Implemented

1. **Recursive Component Pattern**
   - CommentItem references itself for nested replies
   - Depth limiting prevents infinite recursion
   - Configurable indentation for visual hierarchy

2. **Optimistic UI Updates**
   - Immediate visual feedback before API confirmation
   - Rollback on error
   - Queue actions during offline state

3. **Polling Strategy**
   - 10-second interval for comment updates
   - Pause when user actively interacting
   - Efficient tree rebuilding on new data

4. **Toggle Behavior**
   - Backend `addOrUpdate()` handles reaction toggles
   - Same reaction clicked removes it
   - Different reaction updates existing

5. **Soft Delete Pattern**
   - Preserve comment tree structure
   - Replace content with placeholder
   - Maintain moderation history

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Flat vs. Nested API Response**
   - API returns flat list for efficiency
   - Frontend builds tree structure in store
   - Supports both flat and tree views

2. **Denormalized Counters**
   - Store reaction_count, reply_count on entities
   - Transaction-safe increment/decrement
   - Balance between consistency and performance

3. **Edit Time Window**
   - 15 minutes enforced in backend
   - Frontend calculates remaining time
   - Prevents indefinite content manipulation

4. **Modal Z-Index Management**
   - Teleport to body element
   - Z-index: 2000 for overlay
   - Click-outside with event.stopPropagation()
