## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Technical Decisions

### 1. Vanilla JavaScript (No Frameworks)
**Rationale:**
- Zero build step initially
- Smaller payload, faster load
- Direct browser execution
- Easier for contributors
- No framework lock-in

### 2. Hash-Based Routing
**Rationale:**
- No server configuration needed
- Works with static file serving
- Simple implementation
- Browser history support

### 3. CSS Custom Properties
**Rationale:**
- Dynamic theme switching
- No CSS-in-JS overhead
- Native browser support
- Clean separation of concerns

### 4. Component-Based Architecture
**Rationale:**
- Reusable UI elements
- Maintainable codebase
- Easy to test
- Scalable structure

### 5. Mobile-First Design
**Rationale:**
- Better mobile experience
- Progressive enhancement
- Performance benefits
- Modern best practice

## \ud83d\udc1b Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue 1: Module Import Paths
**Problem:** ES6 modules require explicit file extensions  
**Solution:** Added `.js` extensions to all import statements

### Issue 2: CORS for Local Development
**Problem:** Fetch API with local files  
**Solution:** Configured headers in API client, will work with backend

### Issue 3: Theme Stylesheet Switching
**Problem:** Multiple theme files loading  
**Solution:** Single theme link with dynamic href update

### Issue 4: Mobile Navigation Overlap
**Problem:** Bottom nav overlapping content  
**Solution:** Added padding-bottom to main container
