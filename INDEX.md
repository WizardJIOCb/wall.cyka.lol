## üîë Key Concepts

### 1. AI-Generated Applications
Users create web apps (HTML/CSS/JS) using AI prompts. The platform queues requests, generates code via Ollama, sanitizes it, and displays in sandboxed iframes.

### 2. Remix & Fork
Users can take someone else's AI-generated app and either:
- **Remix**: Modify the prompt and regenerate
- **Fork**: Copy the code and edit manually

### 3. Bricks Currency
Virtual currency that controls AI generation costs. Users earn daily bricks and spend them on generations based on token usage.

### 4. Prompt Templates
Users can save successful prompts as reusable templates, share them with the community, and build a collaborative knowledge base.

### 5. Collections
Users curate collections of AI apps, making it easy to discover and showcase quality work.
